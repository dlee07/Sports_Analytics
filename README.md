Some of my Sports Analytics Pieces

Above are folders that contain code, datasets, and visuals that I made to create Sports Analytics Content on Twitter. 
The datasets were created by using the notebooks in "web scrapers", where a web-scraping program is implemented. 

Here are the links to my pieces:
